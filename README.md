# Movie Recommendation System
A content based movie recommender system using cosine similarity
This project is a movie recommendation system built using cosine similarity to suggest movies based on user input and preferences.
The system computes similarity between movie feature vectors and provides recommendations. 
It is deployed using Streamlit for an interactive user experience.
## Tech Stack
### Python: Core programming language.
### Pandas: For data manipulation and feature extraction.
### Scikit-learn: For cosine similarity calculations.
### Streamlit: For deploying the web application.
### NumPy: To handle numerical operations.

## Future Enhancements
Integrate collaborative filtering methods for enhanced recommendations.
Implement caching for faster recommendations.

## DATASET
The project uses a dataset of movies with various features (such as genre, ratings, etc.) to compute recommendations.
